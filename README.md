# CobblemonStats-Backend

This is the backend for the CobblemonStats project. It is a simple REST API that allows you to get data about the Cobblemon game.

## Starting the server

You can start the server by running the following command:
```bash
wiibleyde@SomeOVHServer:~$ /bin/python3 main.py
```

Configuration is done in the environment variables.

## API

The API is very simple. It has only one endpoint that allows you to get the stats of a Cobblemon. The endpoint `/api/v1/` gives you a list of all endpoints available.
